	<h3>5. Send Money and Request Money Payment Services</h3>	

	<h3><i>5.1. United States & Canada</i></h3>
	
	<p>Send Money and Request Money Transactions from Tilt Users with a United States Country Designation are powered by WePay, Inc as a payments facilitator of Vantiv, LLC, with the payment services provided by Fifth Third Bank. Tilt Users with a Canadian Country Designation are processing with WePay Payments Canada Inc. and Home Trust Company. WePay, Inc. and WePay Payments Canada, Inc. are collectively, and as applicable to your Designated Country (“<span style="color: #00A0D8"><b>WePay</b></span>”).<p>

	<p>By accepting these Processor Terms, you agree that you have reviewed the WePay Terms of Service and Privacy Policy applicable to your Designated Country, which are provided in Part A, Section 3, and agree to them.</p>

	<p>In using the Send Money and Request Money service through Tilt, you are also creating a customer merchant account with WePay for the Payment Services to be used in connection with Send Money and Request Money. This WePay account of yours may only be used in connection with such Tilt Services. However, you may create an additional account with WePay for use in connection with other third parties. Any breach of WePay’s applicable terms of service will be treated as a breach of these Processor Terms.</p>

	<h3><i>5.2. Europe - Appointment of Tilt UK as Limited Payment Commercial Agent for Payee & Tilt UK as Trustee</i></h3>

	<p>Tilt UK enables the Send Money and Request Money Tilt Services to limited countries in the European Union. See our FAQ on <a href="">Where is Send Money and Request Money Available</a>.Tilt UK provides Payment Services for the Send Money and Request Money services Tilt Users in the European Union as merchant of record. Tilt UK contracts with a third party payment processor to process the payments in connection with Send Money and Request Money Services.</p>

	<p>Each Recipient hereby appoints Tilt UK as the Payee’s limited payment commercial agent solely for the purpose of accepting Send Money and Request Money payment transactions on the Tilt Services, including any applicable Tilt Fees.<p>

	<p>Upon Tilt UK’s collection of Payor’s payment for the Payee, your payment obligation to the Payee is extinguished, and Tilt UK is responsible for remitting the payment (less applicable Tilt Fees), in the manner described in these Processor Terms and the <a href="http://policies.tilt.com/global/terms.html">Tilt Terms</a>. In the event that Tilt UK does not remit any such amounts as described in these Processor Terms and the <a href="http://policies.tilt.com/global/terms.html">Tilt Terms</a>, such Payor will have recourse only against Tilt UK.</p>

	<p>Each Payee understands that as Tilt UK accepts payments from Payors as the Payee’s limited payment commercial agent and that Tilt UK’s obligation to pay the Payee is subject to and conditional upon successful receipt of the associated payments from Payors. Tilt UK does not guarantee payments to Payee for amounts that have not been successfully received by Tilt UK from Payors.</p>

	<p>Funds received by Tilt UK as the Payee’s limited payment commercial agent will be placed into trust for the Payee’s benefit. Tilt UK will arrange for the payment processor to send funds from the trust account to Payee’s “nominated account”. Payee can provide Tilt UK with Payee’s nominated account in the profile settings. It will need to be a bank account in your name and in your country of residence, unless Tilt specifically permits otherwise. Tilt UK will instruct the payment processor to send the funds to your nominated account promptly, once you have provided your nominated account, satisfied compliance checks and any other conditions for payout. The payment processor will not have any responsibility to you once it has followed our instructions to send funds to your nominated account. In some circumstances, the law (for example, anti-money laundering laws) may prevent funds being paid by the payment processor into or out of the trust account. We will not be responsible for this.</p>

	<p>Each Payee agrees that Tilt UK may, in accordance with a Payee initiated refund or these Processor Terms, refund payment amounts to a Payor. In some circumstances, a Payor may have a right to demand a cancelation, refund, or return of their payment, for example if they pay by card they may have rights to refunds under their card agreement or by law. The payment processor may take the amount of any cancelation, return or refund from funds paid or due to be paid to you into the trust account, and pay them back (or we may ask them to pay it to us as reimbursement, if we have already paid for a refund on your behalf). If there are not sufficient funds in the trust account, we may contact Payee for payment by some other way.</p>

	<p>If Payor is unhappy with a cancelation, refund, or return, we suggest you raise the matter directly with the Payee, as that will be the most efficient process in most cases. If you cannot come to an agreement, please let us know so we can help. Both the Payee and Payor authorize Tilt UK to deal with the dispute or complaint as it sees fit and agree to abide by any decisions Tilt UK may make in such circumstances, including requiring refunds to be made. If the Payee or Payor are not satisfied with Tilt UK’s provided remedy, they can seek other relief as substitute, however, Tilt’s decision will be final and acceptance of it means you accept that as your exclusive relief. You can contact us at happiness@tilt.com to report a dispute.</p>

	<p>If a Payor initiates a Chargeback, the debit or credit card issuer or the originating bank, not Tilt, will determine whether the Chargeback is valid and to whom payment is due.</p>

	<p>When a Payor initiates a Transaction that is in a currency different than that of Payor’s currency, then the applicable exchange rate to apply will be determined by the Processors and will be determined when the transaction is fully processed. For example, if you make a Transaction with a Sell Something campaign that does not reach the Minimum Amount until 10 days after your Transaction, then the exchange rate you pay will be based on when the Minimum Amount is reached (10 days after you initiated your Transaction). The total amount to be charged in your local currency that Tilt displays on the Tilt Services is an estimate only.</p>

Tilt may resubmit any ACH debit to your account that is returned for insufficient or uncollected funds, except as otherwise provided by NACHA's ACH rules (collectively, the "<span style="color: #00A0D8"><b>ACH Rules</b></span>"), or applicable law.</p>

	<h3>1. Payment Source Limitations<h3>

	<p>In order to manage risk and the integrity of the Tilt Services and social payment network, Tilt may limit your available Payment Method or Payout Method on the Tilt Services from time to time. <b>The various funding sources have different dispute resolution rights and procedures in the event your transaction turns out to be unsatisfactory.

    <td><p>15.00 USD</p></td>	
   </tr>
</table>

	<p>Your payment to Tilt of the Reversal fee satisfies the chargeback fee otherwise due by you to the Processors for that specific transaction.</p>

	<p>If Tilt UK or a Processor makes a payment to you for a claim, Reversal or Chargeback that you file against a Payee of your Transaction, you agree that Tilt assumes your rights against the Payee and third parties related to the payment, so long as the Processor agrees, and Tilt may pursue those rights directly or on your and the Processor’s behalf, in Tilt’s discretion.</p>

	<p>You agree to allow Tilt to recover any amounts owed by you to Tilt pursuant to the Tilt Terms or these Processor Terms by charging your payment card, by ACH, or to reimburse Tilt through other means. If Tilt is unable to recover the funds from your payment card or other payment source, Tilt may attempt to contact you, recover the funds from your alternate funding sources, or may take other legal actions to collect the amount due, to the extent allowed by applicable law.</p>

	<h3>3. Your Additional Liability</h3>

	<p>You are responsible for all Reversals, Chargebacks, Disputes, claims, fees, fines, penalties and other liability incurred by Tilt, a Tilt user, or a third party caused by or arising out of your breach of the Tilt Terms and these Processor Terms, and/or your use of the Payment Services. You agree to reimburse Tilt, a user, or a third party for any and all such liability.</p>

	<p>You acknowledge that you are responsible for the accuracy of all payments instructions provided to Processors through the Tilt Services, including but not limited to the accuracy of the amount to be paid and the Payee’s information.</p>

	<h3>4. Reserves</h3>
	
	<p>You agree that Tilt may in its sole reasonable discretion recommend the applicable Processor to place a Reserve on your Transactions when (i) such Transactions involve Transaction Risk or (ii) there may be a higher than acceptable level of risk or exposure associated with your Tilt Account (based on the information available to Tilt Payments at the relevant time and what in its sole discretion Tilt Payments regards as an acceptable level of risk or exposure to you, Tilt Payments under all the circumstances). If your Account is subject to a Reserve, whether recommended by Tilt Payments or Processors, Tilt Payments or the Processors will provide you with a notice specifying the terms of the Reserve, according to the applicable terms of service.</p>

	<p>The terms of the Reserve may change at any time by providing you with notice of the new terms. You may close your Tilt Account if you object to the Reserve. If your Tilt Account is closed for any reason, the Processors have the right to maintain a Reserve for so long as is reasonable under the circumstances and Tilt may request the Processors refund or Reverse all Transactions not disbursed to Payee, including those maintained as a Reserve by the Processor.</p>

	<p>You hereby instruct and authorize Tilt Payments to fund the Reserve through (i) debiting your bank account, (ii) through other sources associated with your Tilt Account, (iii) requesting that you provide funds to Tilt for deposit, or (iv) instructing the Processor to withhold any amounts due for disbursement.</p>

	<p><b>In addition to any Reserve the Processor may maintain at Tilt Payment’s recommendation, you are also subject to any Reserve Processor may decide to maintain according to Processor’s applicable terms of service. Tilt will consider any Reserve held by a Processor as part of Tilt’s Transaction Risk consideration, but may recommend Reserves in addition to what Processor may already maintain.</b></p>

	<h3>5. Our Collection Rights</h3>
	
	</p>To the extent permitted by law, you hereby authorize Tilt Payments to and Tilt Payments may collect any obligations you owe Tilt Payments under the Tilt Terms and these Processor Terms by deducting the corresponding amounts from the Reserve held by the Processors or from funds otherwise payable to you via the Tilt Services. If the settlement amounts or Reserve are not sufficient to meet your obligations to us, Tilt Payments may debit the Payout Method provided in your Tilt Account for any amounts owed to Tilt Payments. Your failure to fully pay amounts that you owe Tilt Payments on demand is a material breach of these Processor Terms and you will be liable for our costs associated with collection in addition to the amount owed, including without limitation attorneys’ fees and expenses, costs of any arbitration or court proceeding, collection agency fees, and any applicable interest.</p>

	<p>If Tilt Payments is unable to collect any amounts you owe Tilt Payments, we may engage in collection efforts to recover such amounts from you. You hereby explicitly agree that you will make all communication to Tilt Payments in relation to amounts owed by electronic mail or by phone. Such communication may be made by Tilt Payments or by anyone on Tilt Payments’ behalf, including but not limited to a third party collection agent.</p>

	<h3>6. Security Interest</h3>

	<p>If your Designated Country is the USA, you grant Tilt a lien and security interest in the Reserve, all transactions (including future transactions), any rights to receive credits or payments under these Processor Terms, and all deposits and other property of yours possessed or maintained by us on your behalf. You will execute, deliver, and pay the fees for any documents we request to create, perfect, maintain and enforce this security interest, even if such request is made after you have established a negative balance with Tilt or the applicable Processor.</p>

	<p>In some cases, we may require a personal guarantee from a principal from your business as a condition of our continuing to provide the Tilt Services to you. If a personal guarantee is necessary, we will specifically inform you in advance.</p>

	<h3>7. Export Control & Restricted Countries</h3>

	<p>You may not use the Payment Services except as authorized by United States law, the laws of the jurisdiction in which you reside, and any other applicable laws. In particular, but without limitation, the Payment Services may not be used to send or receive funds: (a) into any United States embargoed countries; or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Denied Persons List or Entity List.

	<h2>F. Claims & Arbitration</h2>

	<h3>1. Governing Law And Claims</h3>

	<p>These Processor Terms and your use of the Payment Services will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States of America, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions. You and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in San Francisco County, San Francisco, California or a United States District Court, Northern District of California located in San Francisco, California for any actions for which the parties retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights, as set forth in the Arbitration, Class Action Waiver and Trail Wavier provisions below. Unless otherwise stated, the Arbitration, Class Action Waiver and Trial Waiver provisions survive any termination of these Processor Terms.

	<h3>2. Arbitration</h3>
	
	<p>You and Tilt each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Tilt, including without limitation federal and state statutory claims, common law claims, and those based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory (collectively, “<span style="color: #00A0D8"><b>Claims</b></span>”) will be settled by final and binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction (meaning the following things don’t have to be arbitrated) to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.</p>

	<h3><i>2.1. Arbitration Rules.</i></h3> You and Tilt agree to submit the Claim to a single arbitrator under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA), including the Optional Rules for Emergency Measures of Protection and the Consumer Arbitration Rules, except as modified by this “Arbitration” Section.

	<h3><i>2.2. Arbitration Process.</i></h3>
	<p>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a <a href="http://www.adr.org/cs/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&dDocName=ADRSTAGE2034889&RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased">form Demand for Arbitration</a>.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>

	<h3><i>2.3. Arbitration Location and Procedure.</i></h3> <p>Unless you and Tilt otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the AAA location closest to your residence. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Tilt submit to the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. The parties are also permitted to seek relief in a small claims court for dispute or claims within the scope of the small claims court’s jurisdiction.</p>

	<h3><i>2.4. Arbitrator's Decision.</i></h3> <p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award, unless the relief provided is less than $5,000, in which case the arbitrator will only identify the amount of the award and the party it is awarded to. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Tilt will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys' fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration in relation to a Demand that the arbitrator did not find to be frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>

	<h3><i>2.5. Fees.</i></h3> <p>Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules; however, if your total damages award does not exceed $25,000, Tilt will pay all such administrative and arbitrator fees.</p>

	<h3><i>2.6. Opt-In Implications.</i></h3> <p>If you opt out of the arbitration agreement (as provided below), or if the arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable, or if you neither are a resident nor have a principal place of business in the United States, you agree to resolve any claim you have with Tilt exclusively as provided above in this Part F, Section 1 (Governing Law and Claims), Section 4 (Class Action Waiver) and Section 5 (Trial Waiver).</p>

	<h3>3. Arbitrator Will Decide Arbitrability</h3>

	<p>The Federal Arbitration Act governs the arbitrability of all Claims between you and Tilt. The arbitrator will decide whether the Claim can be arbitrated. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.</p>

	<h3>4. Class Action Waiver</h3>

	<b>
	<p>You and Tilt agree that each may bring a Claim against the other only in an individual capacity and not on behalf of any class of people. You and Tilt agree not to participate in a class action, a class-wide arbitration, Claims brought in a representative capacity, or consolidated Claims involving another person’s account. You and Tilt agree not to combine a Claim subject to arbitration under these Processor Terms with a Claim that is not eligible for arbitration under these Processor Terms.</p>

	<p>If this prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties is found to be unenforceable, then the arbitration agreement in Part F, Section 2 and 3 will be null and void.</p>
	</b>

	<h3>5. Trial Waiver</h3>

	<p><b>You and Tilt agree to waive the right to and to not seek a trial by jury for all Claims.</b> </p>
	
<h3>6. Your Right to Opt Out of Arbitration</h3>

<b>
<p>You may opt out of the agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Tilt can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Tilt within 90 days of the date that you agreed to these Processor Terms or future updated terms. You can submit your notice either by mail or online by sending us this form fully completed.</p>

<p>If Tilt modifies provisions in the “Arbitration" section after the date you first accepted these Processor Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Processor Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Last Updated" date above or in the date of Tilt’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Claim between you and Tilt in accordance with the previous applicable provisions as of the date you first accepted these Processor Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Processor Terms), unless you previously opted out of arbitration. </p>

</b>

	<h3>7. Expiration of Claims</h3>

	<p>To the extent permitted by law, you agree to file any claim you may have against Tilt within one year after such claim arose. Otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>
