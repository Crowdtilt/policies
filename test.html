	<h3>5. Send Money and Request Money Payment Services</h3>	

	<h3><i>5.1. United States & Canada</i></h3>
	
	<p>Send Money and Request Money Transactions from Tilt Users with a United States Country Designation are powered by WePay, Inc as a payments facilitator of Vantiv, LLC, with the payment services provided by Fifth Third Bank. Tilt Users with a Canadian Country Designation are processing with WePay Payments Canada Inc. and Home Trust Company. WePay, Inc. and WePay Payments Canada, Inc. are collectively, and as applicable to your Designated Country (“<span style="color: #00A0D8"><b>WePay</b></span>”).<p>

	<p>By accepting these Processor Terms, you agree that you have reviewed the WePay Terms of Service and Privacy Policy applicable to your Designated Country, which are provided in Part A, Section 3, and agree to them.</p>

	<p>In using the Send Money and Request Money service through Tilt, you are also creating a customer merchant account with WePay for the Payment Services to be used in connection with Send Money and Request Money. This WePay account of yours may only be used in connection with such Tilt Services. However, you may create an additional account with WePay for use in connection with other third parties. Any breach of WePay’s applicable terms of service will be treated as a breach of these Processor Terms.</p>

	<h3><i>5.2. Europe - Appointment of Tilt UK as Limited Payment Commercial Agent for Payee & Tilt UK as Trustee</i></h3>

	<p>Tilt UK enables the Send Money and Request Money Tilt Services to limited countries in the European Union. See our FAQ on <a href="">Where is Send Money and Request Money Available</a>.Tilt UK provides Payment Services for the Send Money and Request Money services Tilt Users in the European Union as merchant of record. Tilt UK contracts with a third party payment processor to process the payments in connection with Send Money and Request Money Services.</p>

	<p>Each Recipient hereby appoints Tilt UK as the Payee’s limited payment commercial agent solely for the purpose of accepting Send Money and Request Money payment transactions on the Tilt Services, including any applicable Tilt Fees.<p>

	<p>Upon Tilt UK’s collection of Payor’s payment for the Payee, your payment obligation to the Payee is extinguished, and Tilt UK is responsible for remitting the payment (less applicable Tilt Fees), in the manner described in these Processor Terms and the <a href="http://policies.tilt.com/global/terms.html">Tilt Terms</a>. In the event that Tilt UK does not remit any such amounts as described in these Processor Terms and the <a href="http://policies.tilt.com/global/terms.html">Tilt Terms</a>, such Payor will have recourse only against Tilt UK.</p>

	<p>Each Payee understands that as Tilt UK accepts payments from Payors as the Payee’s limited payment commercial agent and that Tilt UK’s obligation to pay the Payee is subject to and conditional upon successful receipt of the associated payments from Payors. Tilt UK does not guarantee payments to Payee for amounts that have not been successfully received by Tilt UK from Payors.</p>

	<p>Funds received by Tilt UK as the Payee’s limited payment commercial agent will be placed into trust for the Payee’s benefit. Tilt UK will arrange for the payment processor to send funds from the trust account to Payee’s “nominated account”. Payee can provide Tilt UK with Payee’s nominated account in the profile settings. It will need to be a bank account in your name and in your country of residence, unless Tilt specifically permits otherwise. Tilt UK will instruct the payment processor to send the funds to your nominated account promptly, once you have provided your nominated account, satisfied compliance checks and any other conditions for payout. The payment processor will not have any responsibility to you once it has followed our instructions to send funds to your nominated account. In some circumstances, the law (for example, anti-money laundering laws) may prevent funds being paid by the payment processor into or out of the trust account. We will not be responsible for this.</p>

	<p>Each Payee agrees that Tilt UK may, in accordance with a Payee initiated refund or these Processor Terms, refund payment amounts to a Payor. In some circumstances, a Payor may have a right to demand a cancelation, refund, or return of their payment, for example if they pay by card they may have rights to refunds under their card agreement or by law. The payment processor may take the amount of any cancelation, return or refund from funds paid or due to be paid to you into the trust account, and pay them back (or we may ask them to pay it to us as reimbursement, if we have already paid for a refund on your behalf). If there are not sufficient funds in the trust account, we may contact Payee for payment by some other way.</p>

	<p>If Payor is unhappy with a cancelation, refund, or return, we suggest you raise the matter directly with the Payee, as that will be the most efficient process in most cases. If you cannot come to an agreement, please let us know so we can help. Both the Payee and Payor authorize Tilt UK to deal with the dispute or complaint as it sees fit and agree to abide by any decisions Tilt UK may make in such circumstances, including requiring refunds to be made. If the Payee or Payor are not satisfied with Tilt UK’s provided remedy, they can seek other relief as substitute, however, Tilt’s decision will be final and acceptance of it means you accept that as your exclusive relief. You can contact us at happiness@tilt.com to report a dispute.</p>

	<p>If a Payor initiates a Chargeback, the debit or credit card issuer or the originating bank, not Tilt, will determine whether the Chargeback is valid and to whom payment is due.</p>
