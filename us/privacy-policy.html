  <h1>Tilt Privacy Policy</h1>
  
  <p>Updated: September 5, 2015</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, store, use, share and protect your personal information. It also lays out the choices and rights you have with respect to this information. This Privacy Policy applies to our Services (see the <a href="http://policies.tilt.com/us/terms.html">Terms of Use</a> for a definition), regardless of how you access them. By using <a href="http://tilt.com">Tilt</a>, <a href="http://open.tilt.com">Tilt/Open</a> or any of our Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you don’t agree, please don’t use the Services.

		<li>Other information that you provide to us, like email messages, posts to Tilt Pages, responses in forms, and  customer support requests. </li>

<p>Where you provide information to us about a third party, such as your friends, you must obtain the consent of that person to the use of their information in accordance with this Privacy Policy before you provide it to us. </p>

<h3><i>Information Sent to Us by Third Parties</i></h3>
	<p>You may log into our Services using Facebook Connect or other similar third-party applications. These applications authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us, which varies from service to service.  We collect, store, and use this information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
	<p>We may also collect information about you from other sources as permitted by law, including credit bureaus, identity verification services, or our payment processors, and combine that data with information we collect on our Services. </p>

<h2>Why We Collect This Information</h2>
	<p>We collect personal information about you so that we can provide secure, smooth, efficient, and customized Services. We may use your personal information to:</p>

			<li>Enable Organizers to promote Pages both on and off the platform.</li>
			<li>Ensure our records are accurate, complete, and verified by third parties, when necessary.</li>

		</ul>

<h2>How We Share This Information</h2>
	
<h3><i>Information Shared on the Services Generally</i></h3>
	<p>Our services are social and community focused, which means some of your activities on the Services will be visible to other Users, as well as more broadly on the internet. </p>
	<p>The extent to which your information is shared depends on whether you are the Organizer of or the Contributor to a public or private Page. In general, expect anyone to be able to see you started or contributed to a public Page. Private Pages are generally not available to the public at large —though it is important to understand that a private Page may be available to others whom you do not expect.</p>
	<p>See our Public v. Private FAQ to <a href="https://support.tilt.com/hc/en-us/articles/206194598-What-s-the-difference-between-public-and-private-tilt-pages-">learn more</a>.</p>

<h3><i>Information Shared with Page Organizers</i></h3>
	<p>If you contribute to a Page, we may share certain personal information about you with the Organizer, including your name, email address, mailing address, the amount of your contribution, and order specifications. We share partial payment information with Tilt/Open Organizers, including the last four digits of your payment card number, so that they can do things like fulfill your order, process refunds, and dispute chargebacks. </p>


<h3><i>Information Shared with Third Parties</i></h3>
	<p>We may share your personal information and/or financial information with:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Payment processors or banking partners in order to facilitate your financial transactions or as required by credit card association rules. </li>
			<li>Credit bureaus and collection agencies to report account information, as permitted by law.</li>
			<li>Verified nonprofit organizations so that they can send you a receipt for your tax-deductible contribution.</li>
			<li>Affiliates or other trusted third parties that process personal information for us or help with our business operations, such as marketing, fraud prevention, compliance, and technology services. </li>
			<li>Other third parties when we believe it is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with the law; (b) protect any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Tilt or our users; or (d) protect Tilt's property rights. If we’re going to release your information in response to legal process, our policy is to provide reasonable advance notice, along with a copy of the request, unless prohibited from doing so by law or court order (e.g., an order under 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b)). Where prior notice is prohibited, our intent is to notify affected users after the non-disclosure period has lapsed. We may disclose information without prior notice if we believe it’s necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person. Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal objections or defenses our users may have to efforts by third parties to compel disclosure of information, including legal orders from the government.</li>
			<li>Companies we plan to merge with or to be acquired by. Should such an event occur, the new entity will step into our shoes for purposes of this Privacy Policy.</li>
			<li>Other third parties with your consent.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>As noted above, Tilt shares information with Page Organizers. Otherwise, Tilt will not provide any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes except with your prior consent. For example, we may from time to time offer co-branded experiences with other companies on the Services, and if we obtain your consent to provide your information to those companies for the identified uses in the consent, then we may share your information with them to be used according to the consents.</p>
	<p>We reserve the right to anonymize your personal data and may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners, including publishers, advertisers, or affiliated sites. For example, we may share information with others to show trends about the general use of the Services.</p>

<h3><i>Promotional Uses</i></h3>
	<p>We may publicaly feature your Page if it is public (but not if its private) and contributions to that Page on an <a href="https://www.tilt.com/examples">examples</a> like Page on the Services. For Tilt/Open Organizers, we may publicaly feature your Page or you as a user on  educational and client list pages and in marketing and promotional materials, including the trademarks you use on our Services. </p>

<h2>Your Privacy Preferences</h2>
	<p>Tilt lets you set your preferences for the use and sharing of your information, including how or when we and Organizers contact you. If you don’t want to have personal information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt out by clicking <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/">here</a>. You may still see generic, non-targeted ads after opting out. If you don’t want to receive newsletters, campaign updates, or marketing communications from us, simply indicate so in your notifications panel. We may call you if you give us your phone number, such as for customer support purposes. If you do not wish for us to contact you by phone, please let us know at privacy@tilt.com. You can review and edit your Personal Information on our Services by adjusting your profile information on Tilt by adjusting your profile information here and on Tilt/Open by visiting the Settings section of the Admin tab when you’re logged in to your account.</p>

<h2>Cookie Policy</h2>
	<p>Like many other websites, we may place small data files on your computer or other device. These data files may be cookies, pixel tags, or other local storage provided by your browser or associated applications. We use these technologies to:</p> 
	<ul>
		<li>Recognize you as a customer.</li>
		<li>Customize our Services, content, advertising, marketing, and targeting, and measure their effectiveness.</li>
		<li>Help ensure that your account security is not compromised, mitigate risk and prevent fraud, and promote trust and safety across our Website and the Services. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>We may use both session and persistent cookies. Session cookies expire and no longer have any effect when you log out of your account or close your browser. Persistent cookies remain on your device until you erase them or they expire. We may tie the information gathered to our users' personally identifiable information.</p>
	<p>Some browsers make it possible for you to signal that you don’t want your internet browsing activity to be tracked. There is currently no consensus on how to best honor these signals, so we don’t respond to “do not track” requests at this time. Declining our cookies may interfere with your use of our Services.</p>
	<p>Our third-party partners also may employ cookies. The use of cookies by others is not covered by this Privacy Policy. </p>

<h2>How We Protect Your Information</h2>
	<p>We and our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/">cloud provider</a> protect your information using physical, technical, and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, and alteration. Safeguards include firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls to the data centers, and information access authorization controls.</p>
	<p>When you enter financial information (such as a payment card number or your bank account information) on our Services, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
	<p>To the extent we transmit and store your cardholder data, we do so under the most stringent credit card security standard: PCI Compliance Level 1. A PCI-certified auditor verified and awarded us this level of security and compliance. 
	<p>We work hard to secure your data, but nobody is perfect. If you discover a vulnerability in our Services, we would be grateful for your report and encourage you to let us know immediately. To report a bug, please email security@tilt.com. </p>
	<p>Learn more about our <a href="http://policies.tilt.com/security">security practices</a>.</p>

<h2>Retention of Your Information</h2>
	<p>We retain information for accounts as long as it’s important to our operations. We may retain information from disabled accounts to improve our services, comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with investigations, enforce our terms of use, and take other actions permitted by law. If we anonymize your information, we may retain that anonymized information indefinitely. The information we retain about you will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our <a href="http://policies.tilt.com/us/terms.html">Terms of Use</a>.</p>

<h2>Social Sharing</h2>
	<p>You can share things on the Services through other services you use like Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp. Please be aware of your settings on those other services. They may collect your IP address, track pages you visit on our site, and set cookies, among other things. </p>
	<p>Our Services include social features and widgets that are provided either by Tilt or a third party. Your use of these features is governed by the privacy policy of the service providing them and we are not responsible for their privacy practices. You are responsible for sharing your and other people’s personal information on these sites.</p>
