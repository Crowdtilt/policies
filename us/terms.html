	<p>Our Terms of Use are the rules that apply to your use of our services (after this, we’ll call them our <b>Terms</b>). By creating an account, creating a page, or contirbuting to a page, you agree to these Terms and the following documents, so please read all of them carefully.</p>

	<p>If you don’t agree, please don’t use Tilt.<p>
_________________________________________________

<h4><b></b><i>NOTE: Arbitration Provision and Your Right to Opt Out
<p>These Terms include a binding arbitration agreement, which provides that certain disputes between you and Tilt will be resolved through binding individual arbitration and will not be decided by a jury or judge. You have the right to opt out of this part of the Terms by sending us <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/o0AGW3Hjvw">this form</a> fully completed in accordance with Section 23, within 90 days of agreeing to these Terms. </p></i></b></h4>
_________________________________________________
<p></p>
<h2>1. Definitions</h2>
	<p>Our <b>Services</b> are Tilt.com (including sub-domains, co-branded pages, and international versions), Tilt mobile applications, <a href="http://open.tilt.com">Tilt/Open</a>, and any other services, products, applications, widgets, and content linking to these Terms. We further describe our Services on our various websites and apps and in communications with you, such as via emails, FAQS, and text messages.</p>
	<p>An <b>Account</b> is your personal registration with Tilt, through which you can use our Services.</p>
	<p>A <b>user</b> is any natural or legal person that has created an Account through the Services.</p>
	<p>An <b>Organizer</b> is a user who creates or manages a Page.</p> 
	<p>A <b>Contributor</b> is a user who contributes to a Page, whether or not the tilt is reached. </p>
	<p>A <b>Page</b> is a solicitation by a user on the Services that is capable of accepting payment transactions from Contributors.</p>
	<p>A Page <b>tilts</b> when enough Contributors have pledged payments to reach the Organizer’s minimum funding goal.</p>

<h2>2. Ground Rules</h2>
	<p>To create or contribute to a Page using the Services, you will need to create an Account with us either via the Services by authenticating through Facebook Connect, or through such similar registration service as we permit from time to time.</p> 
	<p>When you register for an Account or use our Services, any information you provide must be true, accurate and complete. You may only use our Services if you are 18 or older. </p>
	<p>Businesses can create accounts on our Services, but the person who creates the account must be able to legally bind the entity. That means you need to have permission from the entity to create an account and agree to these Terms on behalf of the entity. Like all users, businesses must comply with these Terms when using our Services.</p>
	<p>In certain circumstances, we may have legal obligations, such as under anti-money laundering laws, to check your identity before you can use our Services or to stop your use of our Services, in whole or in part, temporarily or permanently.  </p>
	<p>You agree to provide any information we may reasonably request and to answer truthfully and completely any questions we may reasonably ask you in order to verify your identity.</p>
	<p>As a condition of using the Services, you authorize us to perform background checks and impose any controls or limitations on your use of Services we deem necessary or appropriate to prevent fraud or abuse of the platform. These controls provide important protections to you as well as Tilt, our partners, and other users. Tilt may suspend or decline transactions in our reasonable discretion. If you are using Tilt for business purposes, you authorize and instruct us to obtain a credit report relating to you at any time when you have an account with us or use the Services.</p>
	<p>You’re responsible for all activities that occur under your account. Tilt isn’t liable for any loss, damage, or other consequences as a result of your or someone else’s use of your account. You should keep your log-in credentials confidential and never share them with a third party.</p>

<h2>3. Organizer Responsibilities </h2>
	<p>If you’re an Organizer, you have responsibilities and duties to your Contributors. Please review our <a href="http://policies.tilt.com/organizer-guidelines.html">Organizer Guidelines</a>. In a nutshell, Organizers must be honest and upfront at all times and make best efforts to fulfill their promises to Contributors.</p>

<h2>4. Contributor Responsibilities </h2>
	<p>Contributors have responsibilities and duties, too, so please take a look at our <a href="http://policies.tilt.com/contributor-guidelines.html">Contributor Guidelines</a>. </p>
	<p>If you’re a Contributor, you make payments to an Organizer at your own risk. Unforeseen or other events may prevent an Organizer from providing goods, services or rewards exactly as promised. If things go awry, please be understanding and consider cutting the Organizer some slack. At the end of the day, though, it’s the Organizer’s responsibility, not Tilt’s.</p>

<h2>5. We Are Not Responsible for Some Things</h2>

	<p>We provide our Services as a neutral platform for users to transact with each other. We’re not directly involved in the transactions between Organizers and Contributors, and do not provide any assurances that Organizers or Contributors will fulfill their obligations to each other or to others. The actions of users are their own, and Tilt doesn’t support, endorse or join them.</p>
	<p>Users may provide links to other websites or resources. If you choose to access them, you do so at your own risk. We don’t control or endorse third-party websites or other resources.  </p>

<h2>6. Transaction Processing</h2>

	<p>All Contributor payment transactions are processed and disbursed by Stripe, our third-party payment processor. Stripe may not support all payment methods, currencies or locations, and is solely responsible for its performance of card processing and their related services.</p>
	<p>By agreeing to these Terms, you agree to be bound by <a href="https://stripe.com/us/terms">Stripe’s Terms of Service</a>. Any breach of those terms will be treated as a breach of these Terms. </p>
	<p>If you are an Organizer using Tilt for business purposes (such as on Tilt/Open or through Sell Something on Tilt.com), and a Contributor’s payment is subsequently reversed (i.e. chargebacks), you authorize the debiting of your designated bank account for the reversed amount and associated fees levied by the payment processor that they were not otherwise able to collect from you.</p>
	<p>Tilt does not hold or control any funds transacted through the Services, except for service fees (explained below) or as otherwise specifically provided in these Terms. To the extent Tilt receives any funds from Contributors, Organizers appoint Tilt as their limited agent for the receipt of those funds.  All such funds will be deemed received by an Organizer upon receipt by Tilt. Organizers will not seek recourse directly from any Contributor for non-payment after that payment is received by Tilt.</p>
	<p>You are responsible for paying any applicable taxes for your use of the Services. </p>

<h2>7. Tilt Fees</h2>
	<p>We only charge service fees to Organizers and Contributors when a Page tilts and funds are processed. At that point, our fees are deducted from the funds. </p>
	<p>Our fees are listed on the <a href="https://www.tilt.com/learn/fees">Tilt.com fees page</a> and the <a href="https://open.tilt.com/pricing">Tilt/Open pricing page</a>, with all fees being non-refundable. We will not change our fees for a Page already in progress, but may do so for existing and ongoing business Pages, such as a Sell Something or Tilt/Open Page, with 90 days prior written notice.</p>
	<p>We have no right to any funds transacted through the Services, except for service fees (explained above) or as otherwise specifically provided in these Terms.</p>
	<p>You may also be subject to fees from third parties for which we are not responsible, such as foreign transaction or exchange fees set by a Contributor’s card issuer, or network or other costs imposed by your telecommunications or internet provider for accessing or using any of the Services. </p>
	<p>You are responsible for paying any applicable taxes or costs for your use of the Services, which are not payable to or through us. </p>

<h2>8. Text Messaging </h2>
	<p>Tilt users may use the Services to send you text messages from time to time. By signing up to use Tilt, you acknowledge and agree that Tilt does not send or initiate such text messages sent to you by a user. Further, by signing up to use Tilt, you agree to receive voice calls and text messages about our Services from us via automatic telephone dialing system and artificial/pre-recorded message at the telephone number you provided as part of your profile on the Services. If you don't want to receive these calls and texts, just indicate so in your account or email us at happiness@tilt.com. You understand that your consent to receive communications in this way isn’t required as a condition to using the Services.</p>
	<p>You may also wish to send text messages to other Tilt users through the Services. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not Tilt, are sending and initiating such text messages. You represent and warrant that every person to whom you send a text message through the Services has given you written consent to receive such messages.</p>

<h2>9. Privacy</h2>
	<p>Your privacy is important to us. To learn about how we handle your personal information, see our <a href="http://policies.tilt.com/us/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h2>10.  Prohibited Activities </h2>

<h2>11. Our Rights </h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Change, eliminate or restrict access to our Services.</li>

			<li>Modify, suspend, close, or remove a Page. </li>

		</ul>
	<p>We periodically review these Terms and may change them from time to time. If we make material changes, we’ll notify you as required by law. If you continue using the Services after notice is provided, you accept the new Terms. If we are required to amend these Terms more quickly by law (i.e., a result of a court decision), we may do so and notify you as soon as possible before or afterwards.<p>

<h2>12. How to Disable Your Account</h2>
	<p>You can disable your account at any time by logging into your account and updating your profile settings. You must disable your own account. We can’t do it for you.</p>
	<p>After you disable your account, your Page will no longer be visible on our Services. However, we retain the content you provided us and the rights to use that content as described in these Terms. For example, contributions to Pages you organized will still appear in the Contributor’s contribution history. We may also retain information as required by law or regulation, our payments vendors’ requirements, or our own retention practices.</p>

<h2>13. Terminated and Abandoned Accounts</h2>
	<p>You can stop using our Services and end your agreement with us at any time without charge, upon which time we will disable your account. However, you will be responsible for any contractual obligations, fees, taxes, or costs that you incurred or authorized before you stopped using the Services.</p>
	<p>If you don’t log in to your account for two or more years, we may disable your account and terminate this agreement without notice. </p>
	<p>If this agreement is terminated (whether by us or by you), we will disable your account and inform the third-party payment processor so they can, as appropriate and set out in their terms of use, refund or forward any remaining funds to your primary address (if we have it).</p>

<h2>15. Warranties and Disclaimers</h2>
	<p>YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.  THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS.  TILT EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND TITLE, AND ANY WARRANTIES THAT MAY BE IMPLIED BY ANY COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, OR USAGE OF TRADE.</p>
	<p>Tilt doesn’t represent, warrant, or guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of the Services, and you rely on the Services at your own risk.  Any material transmitted, accessed, or stored through use of the Services is done at your own discretion and risk and you are solely responsible for any damage or loss of data that results from the transmission, access, or storage of any material through the Services.  No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from Tilt or through or from the Services creates any warranty not expressly stated in this agreement.  Some jurisdictions don’t allow the disclaimer of implied warranties in contracts, so the contents of this section may not apply to you.  Nothing in this section is intended to limit any rights you may have which may not be lawfully limited.</p>

<h2>16. Indemnity</h2>
	<p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Tilt and Tilt subsidiaries and our officers, directors, agents, partners, and employees from any and all claims, damage, loss, liability, cost, and expenses (including attorney and professional fees) resulting from any demand, claim, investigation, or proceeding arising out of, related to, or in connection with the following, without limitation: (A) your use of the Services, (B) your breach of these Terms, or of any representation or warranty contained herein, (C) your violation of any third-party right, including, without limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right, (D) your violation of any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances, or orders of any governmental or quasi-governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities, or (E) any misrepresentation made by you. Tilt will give you notice of any such matter; however, any failure or delay by us doesn’t negate your defense or indemnification obligations or waive Tilt’s rights to seek payment for defense or indemnification from you. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter that is subject to defense or indemnification, and you agree to cooperate fully in the defense of any such claim, demand, investigation, proceeding, or matter. You will not settle any claim that affects Tilt or any of the parties listed above without Tilt’s prior written approval.</p>

<h2>17. Limitations of Liability</h2>
	<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TILT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, GOODWILL OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES RESULTING FROM (A) YOUR ACCESS TO, USE OF, INABILITY TO ACCESS OR INABILITY TO USE OUR SERVICES; (B) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY USER OF OR THIRD PARTY ON OUR SERVICES OR ANY PAYMENT PROCESSOR, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES OR CONDUCT THAT VIOLATES THE COMMUNITY GUIDELINES, ORGANIZER GUIDELINES OR CONTRIBUTOR GUIDELINES; (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT; (D) ANY INACCURATE INFORMATION POSTED ON OUR SERVICES; OR (E) OUR DECISION TO PUBLISH OR REMOVE ANY INFORMATION ON OUR SERVICES. NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL TILT’S TOTAL LIABILITY OF ALL KINDS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SERVICES  (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTY CLAIMS), REGARDLESS OF THE FORUM AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY ACTION OR CLAIM IS BASED ON CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT TILT HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (US $100) OR THE AMOUNT OF FEES YOU PAID TILT IN DIRECT CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM FOR LIABILITY. BECAUSE SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. </p>
	<p>If you have a dispute with any user, including, but not limited to, any Organizer or Contributor, arising out of, in connection with, or regarding your or their use of the Services, you agree to release Tilt (and our parent, our affiliates and our and their respective officers, directors, agents, joint ventures, employees and suppliers) from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.  You expressly waive any protections of any state or territory (whether statutory or otherwise) that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those claims that you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release.</p>
	<p>If you are a California resident, you acknowledge that you have read and understand, and expressly waive, the benefits of California Civil Code § 1542, which states, “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”</p>

<h2>18. Law Governing Legal Disputes</h2>
	<p>The laws of the State of California govern this agreement, as well as any dispute, claim, or controversy that may arise between you and Tilt, without regard to conflict of law provisions.  </p>

<h2>19. Arbitration</h2>
	<p>We’d like to resolve any disputes fairly, quickly, and with minimal fuss.  Toward that end, if you have any issue with Tilt, please contact us and we’ll try to work with you to resolve the matter informally.  </p>
	<p>To the extent permitted by law, you agree to file any claim you may have against Tilt within one year after such claim arose. Otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.<p>
	<p>If we can’t solve that dispute informally, and if you are a resident of or have your principal place of business in the United States, you and Tilt agree to resolve any claim against each other through final and binding arbitration, including a claim involving Tilt’s affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents, and its affiliates’ officers, directors, employees and agents. </p>
	<p>You and Tilt agree to submit the dispute to a single arbitrator under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA), including the Optional Rules for Emergency Measures of Protection and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, or, by separate mutual agreement, to another arbitration institution. </p>
	<p>The AAA’s rules and a description of the arbitration process are available at <a href="www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>.</p>
	<p>The location of the arbitration and the allocation of fees and costs shall be determined under the AAA rules. However, Tilt will reimburse you for all AAA administrative fees in disputes that are subject to the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes unless the arbitrator determines that a claim or counterclaim was filed for purposes of harassment or is patently frivolous.  </p>
	<p>The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Tilt will pay for all reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees, as long as the arbitrator determines that your claim is non-frivolous. If you win an arbitration award that’s more generous than any offer we made to settle the dispute, Tilt will pay you an extra $1,500 on top of the award. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
	<p>If you opt out of the arbitration agreement (as provided below), or if the arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable, or if you neither are a resident nor have a principal place of business in the United States, you agree to resolve any claim you have with Tilt exclusively in a state or federal court located in the City and County of San Francisco, California. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in the City and County of San Francisco, California for purpose of litigating all such disputes.</p>
	<p>Nothing in this section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property, or unauthorized access to the Services.</p>
	<p>This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your Services.</p>

<h2>20. Arbitrator Will Decide Arbitrability</h2>
	<p>The Federal Arbitration Act governs the arbitrability of all disputes between you and Tilt.  The arbitrator will decide whether the dispute can be arbitrated. </p>

<h2>21. Class Action Waiver</h2>
	<p><b><i>You and Tilt agree that each may bring a dispute against the other only in an individual capacity and not on behalf of any class of people.  You and Tilt agree not to participate in a class action, a class-wide arbitration, claims brought in a representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s account. You and Tilt agree not to combine a claim subject to arbitration under this agreement with a claim that is not eligible for arbitration under this agreement.</i></b></p>
	<p><b><i>If this prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties is found to be unenforceable, then the arbitration agreement in Section 19 and 20 will be null and void.</i></b></p>

<h2>22. Trial Waiver</h2>
	<p><b><i>You and Tilt agree to waive the right to a trial by jury for all disputes.</i></b></p>

<h2>23. Your Right to Opt Out of Arbitration</h2>
	<p><b><i>You may opt out of the agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Tilt can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Tilt within 90 days of the date that you first agreed to these updated Terms. You can submit your notice either by mail or online by sending us  <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/o0AGW3Hjvw">this form</a> fully completed. </i></b></p>
	<p><b><i>To opt out by mail, send your written opt-out notice to this address:</i></b></p>
	<p><b><i> Tilt.com, Inc.	<br>Attn: Arbitration Opt-Out 	<br>370 Townsend Street 	<br>San Francisco, CA 94107	</i></b></p>
<p><i><b>Your written opt-out notice must include (1) your name and residence address, (2) the email address and/or mobile telephone number associated with your account, (3) a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement, and (4) your signature.</i></b></p>

<h2>24. Geographic Restrictions</h2>
	<p>You agree to comply with all laws, restrictions, and regulations relating to the export of products and information. For purposes of the U.S. Export Administration Act Export Laws, you warrant that you are: (a) not a citizen of, or otherwise located within, an embargoed nation (including without limitation the Office of Foreign Assets Control comprehensively embargoed countries of Iran, Syria, Cuba, North Korea and Sudan and certain Specially Designated Nationals listed by OFAC as updated from time to time and (b) not otherwise prohibited under the export laws from receiving such products and information.</p>

	<p>We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Tilt. You can email your feedback <a href="http://us.support.tilt.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">here</a>. We aren’t obligated to compensate you for your feedback.</p>

<h2>26. Software Updates</h2>
	<p>You agree that software of ours that you download, such as a stand-alone software product, an application, or a browser plugin, may periodically download and install upgrades, updates and additional features from us in order to improve, enhance, and further develop that software.</p>

<h2>27. Other</h2>
	<p>These Terms (and any other terms of use or service, policies or guidelines we refer to in this document) make up the entire agreement between you and Tilt, and supersede any prior agreements. If any part of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any change to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and signed by us. You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms to anyone else without our prior written consent. Nothing in these Terms shall prevent us from complying with the law. </p>
	<p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may freely assign all of our rights and obligations under these Terms in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise.</p>
	<p>If you are resident of or are locate or have a principal business in the United States, these Terms are between you and Tilt.com, Inc., which is located at 370 Townsend Street, San Francisco, CA 94107.</p>
