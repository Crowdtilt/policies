    <h2 align="center">TERMS</h2>
    <h2>1. Eligibility.</h2>
      <p>The Sellers’ Sharing  Contest (the “<u>Contest</u>”) is open to legal residents of the 50 United States and the District of Columbia, who are 18 years of age or older as of the date of entry.  The transfer of a reward from an ineligible to an eligible person is prohibited.  All applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations apply. Offer void where prohibited. IF AN ENTRANT DOES NOT MEET THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS IN THESE RULES, THE ENTRANT IS NOT ELIGIBLE TO WIN A REWARD AND SPONSOR RESERVES THE RIGHT NOT TO AWARD THE APPLICABLE REWARD TO THE ENTRANT.</p>
     
    <h2>2. Contest Period.</h2>
      <p>The Contest period begins when the Campaign was created on Tilt and ends when the Campaign “<u>Expiration Date</u>” (defined in the next sentence) (“<u>Contest Period</u>”). Expiration Date means the initial expiration date of the Campaign, but if the expiration date is either extended or if the Campaign is reopened within 48 hours of it initially expiring, then the Expiration Date is the date of expiration of the extended or reopened Campaign.</p>
     
    <h2>3. How to Enter.</h2>
      <p>No purchase necessary to enter or win.  To enter, visit the Campaign page on the Tilt.com website, and while logged into your Tilt account invite others to participate in the Campaign through Tilt invitation features, such as by clicking the ‘Invite Friends’ box on the Campaign page and then follow the instructions in the lightbox that pops up to invite a friend to participate in the Campaign; For each bona fide invitation sent to a unique individual via a lightbox on Tilt, you (the “<u>Entrant</u>”) will receive one entry in the Contest (the “<u>Entry</u>”). Each Entrant will only receive one Entry for sending multiple invitations to the same invitee, but may receive additionally Entries by sending invitations to other invitees.</p>
       
      <p>All requested information must be provided for an Entry to be valid.  Entrant may not include in an invitation any materials that infringe any intellectual or proprietary right of another (including trademarks and logos), are unlawful, libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, indecent, lewd, suggestive, violent, harassing, threatening, abusive, inflammatory, fraudulent or otherwise objectionable, or display, describe or encourage the use of a product or service that could be offensive, inappropriate or harmful to Sponsor or any other person or depict the use of a product in a manner that is contrary to any instruction or warnings related to the product.  Entrant may not submit any invitation that is a commercial solicitation or includes promotional materials or the address, phone number, or URL of a commercial entity other than regarding Sponsor. Entries and entrants may be subject to verification by Sponsor in its sole discretion. Incomplete entries or entries not complying with these Rules are subject to disqualification, at Sponsor’s sole discretion.  Proof of submission does not constitute proof of entry.  Sponsor reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to void any and all Entries of an Entrant who submits an entry. By entering a Contest, you will not be eligible to receive any prizes awarded in any other Contest unless you enter each Contest separately.</p>
     
    <h2>4. Selection.</h2>
      <p>Sponsor will select the number of Entrants that is specified in the Campaign who received the highest number of Entries during the Contest Period as the winners (“<u>Winners</u>”), in Sponsor’s sole judgment.  Winners will be notified by email within five (5) days of the end of the Contest Period. The odds of winning depend on how many entries are made and your relative skill in making numerous entries. To claim a reward, a Winner should follow the instructions contained in his or her notification.  Sponsor’s decisions shall be final and binding on all matters relating to the Contest selections.</p>
     
    <h2>5. Rewards and Approximate Retail Value (“<u>ARV</u>”).</h2>
      <p>The reward is what is described either in the Campaign, including the contribution flow, for referring others to the Contest (the “<u>Reward</u>”). The Reward will be awarded to each of the Winners. The ARV is as described in the Campaign. Total ARV of Rewards is the number of Winners multiplied by the ARV of a Reward. The Total ARV of Rewards cannot exceed $5,000. In the event the Total ARV of Rewards exceeds $5,000, the Sponsor will reduce the number of Winners, such that the Total ARV of Rewards will be less than $5,000. The new Winners will then be those Entrants that received the highest number of Entries during the Contest Period, such that the total ARV of Rewards for the Winners is less than $5,000. Odds of winning depend on the number of eligible entries received.</p>
     
    <h2>6. Reward Restrictions: Limit one (1) Reward per person.</h2>
    <p>Sponsor and Tilt do not make, nor in any manner are responsible or liable for, any warranty, representation or guarantee, express or implied, in fact or in law, relative to the Rewards including but not limited to their quality, fitness for purpose, or condition.  Any product and/or brand images are trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective companies, which are not sponsors or affiliated with this Contest. Rewards are non-transferable and non-changeable and no cash redemption or substitution is permitted.  Rewards will be deemed void if sold, transferred, auctioned or assigned to any third party.  Sponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to substitute a Reward in whole or in part with one of comparable or greater value. Each Reward will be awarded "AS IS" and WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, express or implied (including, without limitation, any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose). All costs and expenses associated with Reward acceptance and use not specifically provided herein are the responsibility of the Winner.  <b>ALL FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH THE RECEIPT OR USE OF ANY REWARDS ARE THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE WINNER.</b>  All Rewards will be awarded.  If a Reward is undeliverable to Entrant or otherwise not claimed by Entrant within three (3) calendar days after delivery of notification, the Reward will be forfeited by Winner.</p>
     
    <h2>7. Winner Notification/Reward Claims.</h2>
      <p>No greater than the number of Rewards stated in the Campaign will be awarded. Winners are subject to verification. The winner of the Reward will be notified by e-mail. All Winners may be required to verify their eligibility by completing, signing, and returning an Affidavit of Eligibility, Liability Release, Publicity Release, and IRS Form W-9 (if required by IRS regulations) (collectively, “<u>Winner Agreements</u>”). A failure to sign such Winner Agreements within 2 calendar days of notice of an Entrant’s selection as a Winner of a Reward may result in Entrant’s forfeiture of the Reward.  If the Reward is forfeited, Sponsor may award the Reward to the next highest evaluated Entrant or such Reward may be forfeited and returned to Sponsor.  If Sponsor elects, a potential Reward Winner will be subject to a confidential background check following notice of his or her selection to confirm eligibility and help ensure that the use of any such person in advertising or publicity for the Contest will not bring Sponsor into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule or reflect unfavorably on the Contest or Sponsor, as determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion.  If Sponsor elects, a potential Reward Winner will be subject to a confidential background check following notice of his or her selection to confirm eligibility and help ensure that the use of any such person in advertising or publicity for the Contest will not bring Sponsor into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule or reflect unfavorably on the Contest or Sponsor, as determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion.  The disclosure of any information which may bring Sponsor into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule or reflect unfavorably on the Contest or Sponsor or the potential Reward Winner’s refusal to cooperate in such background check may result in the disqualification of the entrant.  Winners may be required to furnish his or her social security number for the sole purpose of preparation of any tax forms as required by law.  Allow 4–6 weeks after notification and verification of Winners for delivery of the Reward.  Sponsor is not responsible for any change of mailing address, email address, and/or telephone number of any Winners.  If a potential Winner is found to be ineligible or not in compliance with these Rules, the Reward will be forfeited by entrant and Sponsor will the next eligible Winner.</p>
