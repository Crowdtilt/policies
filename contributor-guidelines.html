    <h1>Contributor Guidelines</h1>

    <p>Thanks for contributing on Tilt! Below are a few important guidelines that all Contributors should know. If for any reason you don’t comply, we may need to refund your contribution and close your Tilt account. If you have any questions about these guidelines, please reach out to us at happiness@tilt.com!</p>

    <h2>Use Tilt only for acceptable purposes.</h2>
    <p>You cannot use Tilt for illegal or otherwise prohibited activities. To learn more, please read our terms of use and acceptable use policy.</p>

    <h2>Understand that there are risks in every transaction.</h2>
    <p>Contributors should understand that as with any transaction, there are risks involved when making contributions on Tilt. For example, unforeseen circumstances can arise preventing an Organizer from providing the items he or she is selling on Tilt. Similarly, there may be unavoidable occurrences—such as bad weather, travel delays, or cancellations—preventing an Organizer from facilitating an event as he or she had hoped.</p>

    <p>We ask that Contributors try to be understanding if an Organizer is unable to carry out their tilt as planned. If something goes wrong and a tilt doesn’t go according to plan, try to come to a resolution with the Organizer directly. If you can’t come to an agreement, please contact us at happiness@tilt.com.</p>

    <h2>Do your research.</h2>
    <p>Sometimes, Organizers seek contributions from the public. They might be selling something, asking for funds to get a new idea off the ground, or seeking donations. If you are contributing to a public tilt, do some research on the Organizer. Check out how many tilt pages he or she has organized. If something doesn’t feel right, trust your gut.</p>

    <p>If you see something on Tilt that violates the law or any of our policies, please let us know by emailing happiness@tilt.com.</p>

    <h2>Be honest.</h2>
    <p>Contributors must be honest in their communications with Organizers and members of The Tilt Team. Please provide true and accurate information about yourself. Organizers and members of The Tilt Team might need to get in touch with you, so it’s important to provide up-to-date and accurate contact information.</p>

    <h2>Pay for any contribution you make.</h2>
    <p>Contributors must pay for any contribution they agree to make. If your payment card expires before it’s charged, you must provide updated payment information.</p>

    <p>You must contact the Organizer directly for refunds, which you can do  from the tilt page. </p>

    <h2>Try to resolve disputes with Organizers informally.</h2>
    <p>Typically, Tilt doesn’t get involved in disputes between Organizers and Contributors. We ask that Organizers and Contributors try their best to come to an agreement directly before reaching out to us. In the event that you can’t work out your dispute informally, you can reach out to us for help at happiness@tilt.com. Depending on the circumstances, we may or may not be able to offer our assistance in reaching a resolution.</p>
