    <h1>Copyright Policy</h1>

    <p>This policy explains how Tilt handles copyright infringement concerns. Tilt complies with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), and we respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement if they comply with the DMCA. We reserve the right to delete or disable content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate accounts for repeat infringers.</p>

    <h2>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act</h2>
    <p>Section 512 of the DMCA sets forth detailed legal requirements for formally reporting copyright infringement to an online service provider like Tilt. Under the DMCA, a copyright holder can ask Tilt to take down allegedly infringing content by sending a “DMCA Takedown Notice.” The DMCA also explains how the user who posted the allegedly infringing content can appeal a removal by submitting a counter-notice, or “DMCA counter-notice.”</p>

    <h2>Important: Are You a Copyright Holder?</h2>
    <p>Before you send a DMCA takedown notice to Tilt, you need to make sure that you hold the copyright in the material you want us to remove, or are authorized act on the copyright holder’s behalf. The DMCA imposes serious legal and financial penalties for sending fraudulent or bad-faith takedown notices. These resources may help you understand whether you hold the copyright in a particular work:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Copyright Basics – The United States Copyright Office</li>
      <li>Copyright – The Digital Media Law Project</li>
      <li>Copyright Law & Public Domain – NOLO</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you are still unsure whether you are a copyright holder, you should consult with an attorney. Tilt cannot give you legal advice.</p>

    <h2>How to Submit a DMCA Takedown Notice to Tilt</h2>

    <p>To send us a DMCA takedown notice, you must provide us the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf (typing your full name will suffice);</li>
      <li>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (for example, a link to your original work or a clear description of the materials allegedly being infringed upon);</li>
      <li>Identification of the infringing material and information reasonably sufficient to permit Tilt to locate the material on our website or services (for example, a link to the page containing the allegedly infringing material);</li>
      <li>Your contact information, including your address, telephone number and email address;</li>
      <li>A statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use of the material in the manner asserted is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and</li>
      <li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Tilt Responds to DMCA Takedown Notices</h2>
    <p>If we receive a DMCA takedown notice, we may remove or restrict access to the allegedly infringing material. If we remove or restrict access to a user’s content in response to a DMCA takedown notice, Tilt will make a good-faith effort to contact the affected user with information about the removal or restriction of access to the allegedly infringing material, including a copy of the DMCA takedown notice, along with instructions for filing a DMCA counter-notice.</p>
    <p>If Tilt receives a DMCA takedown notice as a result of material you posted to our website or services, we may remove the material at issue and may disable access to your account or tilt page until the dispute is resolved or the DMCA process is complete. You will receive an email from Tilt with important information about the copyright notice, including a copy of the notice and instructions on filing a DMCA counter-notice. Please read this email carefully. Tilt cannot mediate disputes between copyright holders and users.</p>

    <h2>How to File a DMCA Counter-Notice</h2>
    <p>If you receive an email from us about a DMCA takedown notice sent in response to material you’ve posted to our website or services and you believe that the material identified in the DMCA takedown notice was misidentified or removed in error, you can file a DMCA counter-notice by following the instructions below. For example, you may state in your DMCA counter-notice that the person sending the DMCA takedown notice does not hold the copyright in the material identified in the DMCA takedown notice or did not realize that you have a license to use the material.</p>
    <p>If you repost the material that was removed in response to the DMCA takedown notice, we may permanently suspend your account. Rather than simply reposting the material, you should file a DMCA counter-notice if you believe that have reason to do so.</p>
    <p>To submit a DMCA counter-notice, please send us the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A physical or electronic signature (typing your full name will suffice);</li>
      <li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled (you can find this information in the email from us about the DMCA takedown notice);</li>
      <li>A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and</li>
      <li>Your name, address and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal district court for the judicial district in which your address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which Tilt may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who sent the copyright notice or an agent of such person.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To submit a DMCA counter-notice, please respond to our original email informing you about the DMCA takedown notice, and include the above information in the body of your reply.</p>

    <h2>What Happens after You Submit a DMCA Counter-Notice</h2>
    <p>If you send us a valid DMCA counter-notice, we’ll promptly forward a copy of the counter-notice to the person who sent us the DMCA takedown notice. If we aren’t told within 10 business days that the person who sent us the DMCA takedown notice is seeking a court order to prevent further infringing activity related to the material on our website or services, we may replace or reinstate access to the material that was removed.</p>

    <h2>Repeat Infringer Policy</h2>
    <p>Tilt maintains a policy that provides for the termination of accounts belonging to users who are repeat infringers. In general, we consider a “repeat infringer” to be user who has uploaded content to our website or services and for whom Tilt has received more than two DMCA takedown notices that comply with the law. We will also suspend or terminate your account if ordered to do so by a court or in other appropriate circumstances, as determined by Tilt in our sole discretion.</p>
