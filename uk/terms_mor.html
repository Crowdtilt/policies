    <h2>2. Definitions</h2>
    <p>An <b>Account</b> is your personal registration with Tilt, through which you can use our Services, whether as a Contributor or an Organiser.</p>
    <p>A <b>Contributor</b> is a User who contributes to a Page using our Services, whether or not the Page reaches its minimum funding goal. </p>
    <p>An <b></b>Organiser</b> is a User who creates or manages a Page. </p>
    <p>A <b></b>Page</b> is a specific online fundraising webpage established on and hosted by the Services. </p>
    <p>A <b></b>User</b> is any person who has created an Account through the Services. </p>
    <p><b>You</b> or <b>Your</b> means a User or anyone else who uses the Services. </p>

    <h2>3. GROUND RULES</h2>
    <p>In order to create or contribute to a Page using the Services, you will need to register and create an Account with us either via the Services or by authenticating through Facebook Connect (or through such similar registration service as we permit from time to time).  We will communicate with you in English, or in another language as required by law.</p>
    <p>You may only use our Services if you are aged 18 years or over. </p>
    <p>When you register for an Account or use our Services, any information you provide must be true, accurate and complete.  </p>
    <p>In certain circumstances, we may have legal obligations (such as under anti-money laundering laws) to check your identity before you can use our Services or to stop you using any of our Services (in whole or in part) temporarily or permanently.  We will let you know we are doing so unless prevented by law from telling you.</p>
    <p>You agree to provide any additional information which we may reasonably request and to answer truthfully and completely any questions we may reasonably ask you in order to verify your identity.</p>
    <p>You’re responsible for all activities that occur under your Account. You should keep your log in credentials confidential and should not allow a third party to access them. </p>

    <h2>4. ORGANISER RESPONSIBILITIES </h2>
    <p>If you’re an <a href="/organizer-guidelines">Organiser</a>, you have responsibilities and duties to your Contributors. Please review our Organiser Guidelines. In a nutshell, Organisers must be honest and upfront at all times, and make best efforts to fulfill their promises to Contributors.</p>
 
    <h2>5. CONTRIBUTOR RESPONSIBILITIES</h2>
    <p>Contributors have responsibilities and duties, too, so please take a look at our <a href="/contributor-guidelines">Contributor Guidelines</a>.</p>
    <p>If you’re a Contributor, you make payments to an Organiser at your own risk. Unforeseen or other events may prevent an Organiser from providing goods, services or rewards exactly as promised; if so, that is the responsibility of the Organiser rather than of us. Please be understanding and consider cutting them some slack.</p>
    
    <h2>6. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME THINGS</h2>
    <p>We provide our Services as a platform for Users to deal with each other. We’re not directly involved in the transactions between Organisers and Contributors, and do not provide any assurances that Organisers or Contributors will fulfill their obligations to each other or to others. The actions of other Users are their own, and we do not support, endorse or join them. </p>
    <p>Users may provide links to other websites or resources. If you choose to access them, you do so at your own risk. We don’t control or endorse such websites or other resources.</p>
    
    <h2>7. PAYMENT PROCESSING AND FEES</h2>
    <h2>7.1 Appointment of Tilt UK as Limited Payment Collection Agent for Organiser</h2>
    <p>Each Organiser hereby appoints Tilt UK as the Organiser’s limited payment collection agent solely for the purpose of accepting Tilt Page payment transactions from Contributors, including Tilt fees.</p>
    <p>Each Organiser agrees that payment made by a Contributor through us, shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to the Organiser, and the Organiser will fulfill the agreement made between the Organiser and the Contributor as if the Organiser has received the Page funds directly. Each organiser agrees that we may, in accordance with an Organiser initiated refund or these Terms, refund payment amounts to a Contributor. Each Organiser understands that as we accept payments from Contributors as the Organiser’s limited payment collection agent and that our obligation to pay the Organiser is subject to and conditional upon successful receipt of the associated payments from Contributors. We do not guarantee payments to Organisers for amounts that have not been successfully received by us from Contributors. In accepting appointment as the limited authorized agent of the Organiser, we assume no liability for any acts or omissions of the Organiser.</p>
    
    <h2>7.2. Fees</h2>
    <p>We only charge service fees to Organisers and Contributors when a Page reaches the minimum amount and funds are then processed, with our fees being deducted from those funds we hold for you as a limited payment collection agent.</p>
    <p>Our fees are listed on our fees page. We may change our fees for a Service we are already providing to you (but not for a Page already in progress) and, if so, we will provide you with 30 days’ written notice before the change takes effect. Our fees are non-refundable.</p>
    <p>We have no right to any funds transacted through the Services, except for service fees (explained above) or as otherwise provided in these Terms.</p>
    <p>Your transaction may be subject to Organiser-specific fees. Any such fees will be listed on our <a href="https://www.tilt.com/learn/fees">fees page</a>.</p>
    <p>You may also be subject to fees set by third parties, for which we are not responsible, such as foreign transaction or exchange fees set by a Contributor’s card issuer, or network or other costs imposed by your telecommunications or internet provider for accessing or using any of the Services.</p>
    <p>You are responsible for paying any applicable taxes or costs for your use of the Services, which are not payable to or through us.</p>
    
    <h2>8. SMS</h2>
    <p>We may send you text messages in connection with the Services from time to time. We don’t use an automatic telephone dialing system or artificial/pre-recorded messages. However, by signing up to use Tilt, you agree to receive voice calls or text messages from us about our Services via automatic telephone dialing system or artificial/pre-recorded message at the telephone number you have provided. You understand that your consent to receive communications in this way isn’t required as a condition to using the Services.</p>
    <p>You may wish to send other Users text messages through the Services. You represent and warrant that every person you send a text message through the Services has given you consent to receive such messages.</p>
    
    <h2>9. PRIVACY</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is important to us. To learn about how we handle your personal information, see our Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>11. OUR RIGHTS</h2>
    <p>We’re always working to improve Tilt and make our services better.  In doing so, we do reserve some rights.</p>

    <p>We may change these Terms by giving you 30 days’ written notice before doing so.  If we are required to amend these Terms more quickly by law (including as a result of a court decision), we may do so and notify you as soon as possible before or afterwards.</p>
    
    <h2>12. HOW TO DISABLE YOUR ACCOUNT</h2>
    <p>You can disable your Account at any time by logging into your Account and updating your profile settings. (You must disable your own Account; we can’t do it for you.)</p>
    <p>After you disable your Account, your Page will no longer be visible on our Services. However, except to the extent where limited by applicable data protection and privacy laws, we retain the content you provided us and the rights to use that content as described in these Terms.

We also retain information as required by law or regulation, our payments vendors or our own data retention practices.</p>
    
    <h2>13. TERMINATION AND ABANDONED ACCOUNTS</h2>

    <p>When this agreement is terminated (whether by us or by you), we will close your Account and inform the relevant third-party payment processors so that they can – as appropriate and set out in their terms of use – refund or forward any remaining funds to your primary address (if we have it).  We will also arrange the refund of any contributions.</p>
