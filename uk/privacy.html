  <h2>How We Share This Information</h2>
  <h3>Information Shared on the Services</h3>
  <p>Our services are social and community focused, which means some of your activities on the Services will be visible to other Users as well as more broadly on the internet. The extent to which your information is shared depends on whether you are the Organiser of or the Contributor to a public or private Page. Generally speaking, expect anyone to be able to see you started or contributed to a public Page and except some level of degree of discretion from private Pages (though it is important to know there are ways that anyone can see a private Page). </p>
  <p>See our Public v. Private FAQ to learn more.</p>

  <h3>Information Shared with Organisers</h3>
  <p>If you contribute to a Tilt Page, we may share certain personal information about you with the Organiser, including your name, email address, mailing address, the amount of your contribution and order specifications. We share partial payment information with Tilt Organisers, including the last four digits of your payment card number, so that they can do things like process and fulfill your order, process refunds, and dispute chargebacks.</p>
  
  <h3>Information Shared with Third Parties</h3>
  <p>We may share your personal information and/or financial information with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Payment service providers or banking partners in order to facilitate your financial transactions or as required by credit card association rules.</li>
    <li>Credit bureaus and collection agencies to report account information, as permitted by law.</li>
    <li>Verified nonprofit organizations so that they can send you a receipt for your tax-deductible contribution.</li>
    <li>Affiliates or other trusted third parties that process personal information for us or help with our business operations for the purposes set out above, such as marketing, fraud prevention, compliance, and technology services. Such affiliates or trusted third parties will be subject to obligations to process such information in compliance with the same safeguards that we deploy and all such disclosures will only be made in accordance with applicable laws.</li>
    <li>Other third parties when we believe it is reasonably necessary to comply with the law or a regulator, protect any person from death or serious bodily injury, prevent fraud or abuse of Tilt or our users, or protect Tilt's property rights. If we’re going to release your information in response to legal process, our policy is to provide reasonable advance notice, along with a copy of the request, unless prohibited from doing so by law or court order. Where prior notice is prohibited, our policy is to notify affected users after the non-disclosure period has lapsed. We may disclose information without prior notice if we believe it’s necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person or other criminal or illegal acts. Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal objections or defenses our users may have to efforts by third parties to compel disclosure of information, including legal orders from the government.</li>
    <li>Companies we plan to merge with or to be acquired by. In the event that Tilt (or a part thereof) is (i) subject to negotiations for the sale of all or any part of its business or assets or (ii) is sold to a third party or undergoes a re-organisation, you agree that any of your personal information which it holds may be disclosed to such third party (or its advisors) as part of any due diligence process or transferred to that re-organized entity or third party and used for the same purposes or for the purpose of analyzing any proposed sale or re-organisation.</li>    
    <li>Other third parties with your consent.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As noted above, Tilt will share information with Organisers for Pages. Tilt will not otherwise provide any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes except with your prior consent. For example, we may from time to time offer co-branded experiences with other companies on the Services, and if we or they obtain your consent for those companies to receive and use your information for purposes identified in the consent, then we will share your information with them.</p>

  <p>We reserve the right to anonymize your personal data and may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners, including publishers, advertisers, or affiliated sites. For example, we may share information with others to show trends about the general use of the Services.</p>
