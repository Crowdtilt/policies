<h2>Referral SMS</h2>

<p>Tilt reserves the right to investigate and review all activities related to the Referral Program and can cancel or modify referrals for any reason. If Tilt notices any activity that we believe is abusive, fraudulent, illegal, or violative of our Terms of Use or other policies, we may suspend profiles or restrict access to the referral program.</p>

<h2>Severability and Waivers</h2>

<p>If any part of these terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining parts shall remain in full force and effect. Any failure by Tilt to enforce these terms shall not be considered a waiver and any waiver of these terms must be made in writing and signed by Tilt.</p>
