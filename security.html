<h1>Security Practices</h1>

<p>Wondering how safe Tilt is to use? If you want to stop reading now and put your mind at ease, let us assure you that Tilt is as safe as your bank.</p>

<p>We’re trusted by leading companies like ESPN and Microsoft to power commerce for their business. We’ve helped local governments and major research universities tilt their visions for the future. And every day, groups of all sizes are making amazing things happen on Tilt.</p>

<p>Here are some of the security measures we’ve put in place to keep everyone’s information safe.</p>

<h2>We’re as safe as your bank.</h2>

<p>All sensitive customer data at Tilt is secured by military-grade encryption on servers that cannot be directly accessed from the internet. We use the same 128-bit encryption and physical security that banks use.</p>

<h2>Our encryption game is strong.</h2>

<p>All of our sites use SSL encryption with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy">Forward Secrecy</a> enabled for clients and browsers that support it. We regularly monitor our SSL implementation for security vulnerabilities and patches. We constantly think of ways to improve our SSL stack by evaluating our certificates, certificate authorities, and supported cipher suites.</p>

<h2>We’re security over-achievers.</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/index.php">PCI Security Standards Council</a> develops and enforces strict payment card data security standards. Tilt is audited by a PCI-certified auditor annually, and we're certified to PCI Service Provider Level 1. This is the most rigorous level of certification available to payment platforms. </p>

<h2>On mobile? We’ve got you covered.</h2>

<p>Our mobile applications use certificate pinning to secure customer data against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">man-in-the-middle</a> attacks.</p>

<h2>Our security team is at the ready.</h2>

<p>If you encounter any issues while using Tilt, please contact us at security@tilt.com. We investigate and respond to all reported security issues as quickly as possible. For the protection of our users, we ask that you not publicly disclose any suspected security issue until we have addressed it.</p>
