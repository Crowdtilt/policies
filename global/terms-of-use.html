<h2>4. Eligibility and Your Tilt Account</h2>

<p>To be eligible to use the Tilt Services you must be 18 years or older and create a Tilt Account with a cellular/wireless telephone number that you own. You may also initiate account registration by connecting to your Facebook account, however, we will still need additional information to create your Tilt Account. As further detailed in our Processor Terms and Privacy Policy, in order to register, create and use a Tilt Account, Tilt may require that you submit certain information, including but not limited to your name, email address, text-enabled cellular/wireless telephone number, street address or zip code, date of birth, and social security number. During the registration process, or when you access the Tilt Services from a phone, your phone's device ID is also stored. You agree that the information you provide to Tilt upon registration and at all other times will be true, accurate, current and complete, and you agree to maintain and update this information with us as necessary.</p>

<p>By granting Tilt access to your Facebook account, you understand that Tilt will access, make available and store (if applicable) any Content that you have provided to and stored in your Facebook account ("<span style="color: #00A0D8"><b>Facebook Content</b></span>") so that it is available on and through the Tilt Services. Unless otherwise specified in these Tilt Terms, all Facebook Content, if any, will be considered to be Tilt User Content for all purposes of these Tilt Terms. Personally identifiable information that you post to your Facebook account may be available on and through your Tilt Account and on the Tilt Services, depending on your privacy settings on Facebook and Tilt. Please note that if Facebook or associated service becomes unavailable or Tilt’s access to your Facebook account is terminated by Facebook, then Facebook Content may no longer be available on and through the Tilt Services.</p>

<p>You’re responsible for all activities that occur under your Tilt Account. You acknowledge, consent and agree that anyone you authorize to use your Tilt Account may use the Tilt Services on your behalf and that you will be responsible for any actions made by such person. Tilt isn’t liable for any loss, damage, or other consequences as a result of your or someone else’s use of your Tilt Account. You should keep your log-in credentials confidential and never share them with a third party. You will immediately notify Tilt of any unauthorized use of your Tilt Account. </p>

<h2>5. How the Tilt Services Work</h2>

<p>The Tilt Services provides an online social community, which can be used along with the Payment Services. The Payment Services are provided by the Processors. Tilt is not a bank, a money transmitter or a money services business (“<span style="color: #00A0D8"><b>MSB</b></span>”) and Tilt does not offer banking, money transmission or MSB services. Unless explicitly stated otherwise in these Tilt Terms or the Processor Terms, Tilt’s responsibilities are limited to making available the Tilt Services. See the Processor Terms for more on the Payment Services and Processors.</p>

<p>TILT IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PAYMENT SERVICES. TILT IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY AND DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY RELATED TO ANY AND ALL TRANSACTIONS. ACCORDINGLY, ANY TRANSACTIONS WILL BE MADE OR ACCEPTED AT THE TILT USER’S OWN RISK.</p>

<h2><i>5.1 Send Money</i></h2>

<p>You may send money to a Payee using Send Money, whether they have a Tilt Account at the time or not. However, there are limitations on whom you can send money to and there are conditions on the Payee’s ability to receive that money (see FAQ on <a href="">Send Money Payee Conditions</a>). </p>

<p>If the Payee is not a Tilt User, the Payee will be required to create a Tilt Account and provide their personal and payout information to claim the money you sent. Upon Payee providing the required information and satisfying compliance and other checks, Processor will initiate a payout that or the following Business Day.  </p>

<p>For up to 30 days from the date of the Payor initiating a Send Money Transaction, the Processor may pre-authorize a Payor’s funding source. Once the Payee has successfully registered as a Tilt User and provided valid payout information for an available Payout Method, the send money Transaction will be settled from Payor’s funding source to be sent to the Payee.</p>

<p>If the Payee does not create a Tilt Account and add their payout information within 30-day period or they reject the Transaction, the Processor may cancel the Transaction and will then refund any applicable amounts to the original funding source. </p>

<p>If the Payee does not or cannot accept the Transaction through the Tilt Services, you agree that you will not hold Tilt liable for any damages resulting from Payee's decision. You may not Send Money to a Tilt Account you control.</p>

<h2><i>5.2 Request Money</i></h2>

<p>You can request money from one or multiple persons. Each payment from a Payor will be sent to you independent of when other persons from whom you requested money pay. Payouts will be initiated by Processor each Business Day.  </p>

<h2><i>5.3 Organize/Collect, Sell Something & Tilt Pro</i></h2>

<p>Tilt Users can create an Organize/Collect, Sell Something or Tilt Pro campaign to crowdfund and sell goods or services. </p>

<p>Organizers have responsibilities and duties to your Contributors. Please review our Organizer Guidelines. In a nutshell, Organizers must be honest and upfront at all times and make best efforts to fulfill their promises to Contributors.</p>

<p>Contributors have responsibilities and duties, too, so please take a look at our Contributor Guidelines.</p>

<p>If you’re a Contributors, you make payments to an Organizer at your own risk. Unforeseen or other events may prevent an Organizer from providing goods, services or rewards exactly as promised. If things go awry, please be understanding and consider cutting the Organizer some slack. At the end of the day, though, it’s the Organizer’s responsibility, not Tilt’s.</p>

<h2>6. Tags & Invites</h2>

<p>You can tag or invite a person to engage in a Transaction using the Payment Services through the Tilt Services, whether the person is a Tilt User or not.  When you tag or invite someone, whether they are a Tilt User or not, you are instructing Tilt to send the person a message using the contact information you provided for them (text message for a cell number and/or email for an email address) according to these Tilt Terms and our Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>7. No Endorsement</h2>

<p>Tilt does not endorse any Tilt User or Transaction. Tilt Users are required by these Tilt Terms to provide accurate information. Although Tilt may, for transparency or fraud prevention or detection purposes, directly or through third parties, ask you to provide a form of government identification, your date of birth, and other information, or undertake additional checks and processes designed to help verify or check the identities or backgrounds of Tilt Users and/or screen Tilt Users information against third party databases or other sources as provided in the Processor Terms, Tilt does not make any representations about, confirm, or endorse any Tilt User or the Tilt User’s purported identity or background.</p>

<p>By using the Tilt Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of other Tilt Users or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the particular Tilt User or other third parties who caused you harm. You agree not to attempt to impose liability on or seek any legal remedy from Tilt with respect to such actions or omissions. Accordingly, we encourage you to communicate directly with other Tilt Users on the Tilt Services regarding any Transaction. </p>

<h2>8. Processors & Payment Services</h2>

<p>Tilt enables Tilt Users to access and use Payment Services provided by Processors. Tilt does not offer the Payment Services. Tilt merely communicates a Tilt User’s Transaction instructions, subject to the Terms of this Tilt Terms and the Processor Terms, to the relevant Processor. </p>

<p>Tilt may not provide Transaction instructions to Processors beyond certain Transaction limits (see our FAQ on <a href="">Send Money Transaction Limits</a>). These Transaction limits may be adjusted up or down, over time, for any reason (including but not limited to limit fraud or credit risk). </p>

<h2>9. Tilt Fees</h2>

<p>The Tilt Fees are listed on the Tilt.com fees page and the Tilt Pro pricing page, with all fees being non-refundable. We will not change our fees for a campaign already in progress, but may do so for existing and prolonged business campaigns, such as a Sell Something or Tilt Pro campaign, with 90 days prior written notice.</p>

<p>Tilt only charges the Tilt Fees to Payees and Payors for a Transaction when the Transaction is processed and funds are captured from the Payor. At that point, Tilt instructs the relevant Processor to deduct the Tilt Fees from the Transaction and disburse the Tilt Fees to Tilt. </p>

<p>We have no right to any funds transacted through the Tilt Services, except for Tilt Fees (explained above) or as otherwise specifically provided in these Tilt Terms and Processor Terms.</p>

<h2>10. Taxes.</h2>

<p>You are responsible for determining your Tax obligations for your Transactions using the Payment Services, as Payor and Payee, and it is your responsibility to connect, report and remit the correct Tax to the appropriate tax authority. Tilt is not responsible for determining whether Taxes apply to your transaction, or for collecting, reporting or remitting any taxes arising from any transaction. </p>

<h2>11. Your Refund Policy and Privacy Policy.</h2>

<p>We recommend that when you sell goods and services through Tilt that you publish a return policy and a privacy policy on your applicable campaign or website.</p>

<h2>12. Text Messaging & Mobile Data</h2>

<p>Tilt users may use the Tilt Services to send you text messages from time to time. By signing up to use the Tilt Services, you acknowledge and agree that Tilt does not send or initiate such text messages sent to you by a Tilt User. Further, by signing up to use Tilt, you agree to receive voice calls and text messages about the Tilt Services from us via automatic telephone dialing system and artificial/pre-recorded message at the telephone number you provided as part of your profile on the Tilt Services. If you don't want to receive these calls and texts, just indicate so in your Tilt Account or email us at happiness@tilt.com. You understand that your consent to receive communications in this way isn’t required as a condition to using the Tilt Services.</p>

<p>You may also wish to send text messages to other Tilt Users through the Tilt Services. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not Tilt, are sending and initiating such text messages. You represent and warrant that every person to whom you send a text message through the Tilt Services has given you written consent to receive such messages.</p>

<p>If you use the Tilt Services on your mobile phone, you are responsible for any fees that your phone service provider charges for text messaging, data services, etc. </p>

<h2>18. Termination and Service Availability</h2>

<h2><i>18.1 Terminating your own Account</i></h2>

<p>You can termination this agreement under the Tilt Terms and Processor Terms by clicking the “Delete Account” button in your privacy settings using our Site (may not be available on the Applications). </p>

<p>After you delete your Tilt Account, your profile page will no longer be visible on the Tilt Services. However, we retain your User Content and the rights to use that content as described in these Tilt Terms after you disable your Tilt Account or termination our agreement under these Tilt Terms. For example, Tilt User Transactions to campaigns to which you were the Payee will still appear in the Payor’s Transaction history and be visible to others as it normally would. We may also retain information as required by law or regulation, the Processors, or our own retention practices.</p>

<p>You cannot delete your Tilt Account to evade a Transaction investigation. If you attempt to close your Tilt Account while Tilt is conducting an investigation, we will keep your Tilt Account open for reasonable time until the investigation is complete. Tilt will inform the relevant Processors of the requested account deletion and the ongoing investigation, which may result in the Processor or Tilt UK, as applicable, placing a Reserve on your Tilt Account or refunds or Reversal of all Transactions not disbursed to you.   </p>

<h2><i>18.2. Service Availability</i></h2>

<p>Tilt reserves the right to refuse use of the Tilt Service to anyone and to reject, cancel, interrupt, remove or suspend any part of the Tilt Services or Transactions at any time for any reason without liability. You remain liable under these Tilt Terms and the <a href="global/processor-terms.html">Processor Terms</a> in respect of all charges and other amounts incurred through the use of your Tilt Account at any time, irrespective of termination, suspension or closure.</p>

<p>Without limiting the foregoing, if Tilt has reason to believe that you have engaged in any restricted activities, made excessive or unexplainable Transactions with the Processors, violated any parts of these Tilt Terms, we may take various actions to protect Tilt, a Tilt User, a third party, or you from Reversals, Chargebacks, Disputes, claims, fees, fines, penalties and any other liability. The actions we may take include but are not limited to the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Close, suspend, or limit your access to your Tilt Account, the Tilt Services or the Payment Services. We will normally give you advance notice of any suspension or cancellation but we may, if it is reasonable to do so (for example if you are in breach of these Tilt Terms or we consider it advisable for security reasons), suspend or cancel your right to use a Payment Method or Tilt Account without prior notice to you;</li>
<li>Modify or remove your User Content at any time if we reasonably suspect it violates these Tilt Terms or <a href="/processor-terms">Processor Terms</a>.</li>
<li>Refuse for the Tilt Services to be used in connection with any particular Transaction at any time for any reason and will only be required to make available the fact of the refusal and the reasons for the refusal and how you may resolve the problem, where possible, upon request and provided it is not prohibited by law;</li>
<li>Recommend a Processor institute a Reserve on your Tilt Account with them or to take other actions; </li>
<li>Contact Payors that sent you money, contact your bank or credit card issuer, and warn other Users, law enforcement, or impacted third parties of your actions;</li>
<li>Refuse to provide our Tilt Services to you in the future; and</li>
<li>Take legal action against you.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you delete your Tilt Account or Tilt terminates your access or availability to the Tilt Services, the Processors will refund any Transactions from you or to you that have not yet been disbursed to the Payee and Tilt will end all campaigns that are still active (meaning that they have not ended or there are still people that have not completed a transaction you requested they complete) and refund or Reverse any Transaction that had not been sent to the Payee. </p>

<h2><i>18.3. Survival</i></h2>

<p>If you or we terminate these Tilt Terms, the clauses of these Tilt Terms and the <a href="global/processor-terms.html">Processor Terms</a> that reasonably should survive termination will remain in effect.</p>

<h2><i>18.4. Abandoned Accounts</i></h2>

<p>If you don’t log in to your Tilt Account for two or more years, we may disable your Tilt Account and terminate this agreement without further notice.</p>

<p>If this agreement is terminated (whether by us or by you), we will disable your Tilt Account and inform the Processors so they can, as appropriate and set out in their terms of service, refund or forward any remaining funds to your primary address (if we have it), as applicable.</p>

You will not settle any claim that affects Tilt or any of the parties listed above without Tilt’s prior written approval.</p>

<h2>21. Limitations of Liability</h2>

<p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE TILT SERVICES AND COLLECTIVE CONTENT, YOUR TRANSACTIONS, YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE REFERRAL PROGRAM, AND ANY CONTACT YOU HAVE WITH OTHER USERS OF TILT WHETHER IN PERSON OR ONLINE REMAINS WITH YOU. NEITHER TILT NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE TILT SERVICES COLLECTIVE CONTENT OR THE PREFERRAL PROGRAM SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, OR FOR ANY DAMAGES FOR PERSONAL OR BODILY INJURY OR EMOTIONAL DISTRESS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH (A) THESE TILT TERMS, (B) FROM YOUR ACCESS TO, USE OF, INABILITY TO ACCESS OR INABILITY TO USE THE TILT SERVICES OR COLLECTIVE CONTENT, (C) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES OR CONDUCT THAT VIOLATES THE PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES SECTION, COMMUNITY GUIDELINES, ORGANIZER GUIDELINES OR CONTRIBUTOR GUIDELINES; (D) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TILT ACCOUNT TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT; (E) ALL ACTIONS TAKEN BY PERSONS YOU AUTHORIZE TO USE YOUR TILT ACCOUNT; (F) ANY INACCURATE INFORMATION POSTED ON THE TILT SERVICES; (G) OUR DECISION TO PUBLISH, MODIFY OR REMOVE ANY INFORMATION ON THE TILT SERVICES; OR (H) YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE REFERRAL PROGRAM, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT TILT PAYMENTS HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>

<p>THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN TILT AND YOU. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

<p>If you have a dispute with any user, including, but not limited to, any Payee or Payor, arising out of, in connection with, or regarding your or their use of the Tilt Services, you agree to release Tilt (and our parent, our affiliates and our and their respective officers, directors, agents, joint ventures, employees and suppliers) from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such Claims. You expressly waive any protections of any state or territory (whether statutory or otherwise) that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those claims that you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release.</p>

<p>If you are a California resident, you acknowledge that you have read and understand, and expressly waive, the benefits of California Civil Code § 1542, which states, “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”</p>

<h2>22. Governing Law And Claims</h2>

<p>These Tilt Terms and your use of the Payment Services will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States of America, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions. You and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in San Francisco County, San Francisco, California or a United States District Court, Northern District of California located in San Francisco, California for any actions for which the parties <b>retain the right to seek</b> injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights, <b>as set forth in the Arbitration, Class Action Waiver and Trail Wavier provisions below</b>. Unless otherwise stated, the Arbitration, Class Action Waiver and Trial Waiver provisions survive any termination of these Tilt Terms.</p>

<h2>23. Arbitration</h2>

<p>You and Tilt each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Tilt, including without limitation federal and state statutory claims, common law claims, and those based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory (collectively, “<span style="color: #00A0D8"><b>Claims</b></span>”) will be settled by final and binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction (meaning the following things don’t have to be arbitrated) to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.</p>

<h2><i>23.1. Arbitration Rules</i></h2> <p>You and Tilt agree to submit the Claim to a single arbitrator under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA), including the Optional Rules for Emergency Measures of Protection and the Consumer Arbitration Rules, except as modified by this “Arbitration” Section.</p>

<h2><i>23.2. Arbitration Process</i></h2> <p>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a <a href="http://www.adr.org/cs/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dDocName=ADRSTAGE2034889&amp;RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased">form Demand for Arbitration</a>. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>

<h2><i>23.3. Arbitration Location and Procedure</i></h2> <p>Unless you and Tilt otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the AAA location closest to your residence. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Tilt submit to the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. The parties are also permitted to seek relief in a small claims court for dispute or claims within the scope of the small claims court’s jurisdiction.</p>

<h2><i>23.4. Arbitrator's Decision</i></h2> <p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award, unless the relief provided is less than $5,000, in which case the arbitrator will only identify the amount of the award and the party it is awarded to. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Tilt will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys' fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration in relation to a Demand that the arbitrator did not find to be frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>

<h2><i>23.5. Fees</i></h2> <p>Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules; however, if your total damages award does not exceed $25,000, Tilt will pay all such administrative and arbitrator fees.</p>

<h2><i>23.6. Opt-In Implications</i></h2> <p>If you opt out of the arbitration agreement (as provided below), or if the arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable, or if you neither are a resident nor have a principal place of business in the United States, you agree to resolve any Claim you have with Tilt exclusively as provided above in this Sections 22 (Governing Law and Claims), 25 (Class Action Waiver) and 26 (Trial Waiver).</p>

<h2>24. Arbitrator Will Decide Arbitrability</h2>

<p>The Federal Arbitration Act governs the arbitrability of all Claims between you and Tilt. The arbitrator will decide whether the Claim can be arbitrated. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.</p>

<h2>25. Class Action Waiver</h2>

<p><b>You and Tilt agree that each may bring a Claim against the other only in an individual capacity and not on behalf of any class of people. You and Tilt agree not to participate in a class action, a class-wide arbitration, claims brought in a representative capacity, or consolidated Claims involving another person’s account. You and Tilt agree not to combine a Claim subject to arbitration under these Tilt Terms with a Claim that is not eligible for arbitration under these Tilt Terms.</b></p>

<p><b>If this prohibition against class actions and other Claims brought on behalf of third parties is found to be unenforceable, then the arbitration agreement in Section 23 and 24 will be null and void.</b></p>

<h2>26. Trial Waiver</h2>

<p><b>You and Tilt agree to waive the right to and to not seek a trial by jury for all Claims.</b></p>

<h2>27. Your Right to Opt Out of Arbitration</h2>

<p><b>You may opt out of the agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Tilt can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding under these Tilt Terms or the Processor Terms. To opt out, you must notify Tilt within 90 days of the date that you agreed to these Tilt Terms or future updated terms.

If additional terms are required for any Tilt Service or other product or service, Tilt will provide you those additional terms and conditions at the time the Tilt Services or other product or service is offered or made available to you.

<h2>35. Independent Contractors</h2>

<p>The parties agree they are independent contractors to each other in performing their respective obligations under these Tilt Terms. Nothing in these Tilt Terms or in the relationship established and developed hereunder shall be deemed or is intended to be deemed, nor shall it cause, the parties to be treated as partners, joint venturers, or otherwise as joint associates for profit.</p>
